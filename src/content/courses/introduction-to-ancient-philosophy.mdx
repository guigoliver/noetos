# Introduction to Ancient Philosophy

Welcome to this foundational course on Ancient Philosophy! Over eight weeks, we'll journey through the intellectual landscape of the ancient Mediterranean world, exploring the ideas that laid the groundwork for Western philosophical thought.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the major philosophical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome. Beginning with the Pre-Socratic natural philosophers and continuing through to the Neoplatonists, we'll examine the evolution of philosophical thought across nearly a millennium of intellectual history.

You'll engage with primary texts, participate in Socratic-style discussions, and develop the analytical skills necessary to understand and evaluate philosophical arguments. No prior background in philosophy is required—just a curious mind and willingness to grapple with profound questions about reality, knowledge, and human flourishing.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Identify and explain** the central ideas of major ancient philosophical schools
- **Analyze and interpret** philosophical texts from the ancient world
- **Compare and contrast** different philosophical approaches to perennial questions
- **Recognize** the historical context that shaped philosophical development
- **Apply** ancient philosophical concepts to contemporary ethical questions
- **Articulate** your own philosophical perspective in dialogue with ancient thinkers

## Teaching Methods

The course combines several pedagogical approaches:

- **Lectures** providing historical context and conceptual clarification
- **Close readings** of primary philosophical texts
- **Socratic seminars** fostering collaborative inquiry
- **Reflective writing** exercises to deepen understanding
- **Multimedia presentations** illustrating philosophical concepts

## Week-by-Week Course Content

### Week 1: Pre-Socratic Thinkers
The course begins with the dawn of Western philosophy in Ionia and Southern Italy. We'll examine how early thinkers sought to explain the cosmos through natural principles rather than mythological narratives.

- The Milesians: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes
- Heraclitus and the doctrine of flux
- Parmenides and the unchanging One
- Pluralists: Empedocles and Anaxagoras
- Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus

### Week 2: Socrates and the Socratic Method
We'll explore the revolutionary approach of Socrates, who shifted philosophy's focus from cosmology to ethics and epistemology, while developing his distinctive method of questioning.

- The "Socratic problem": Sources for understanding Socrates
- Socratic ignorance and the examined life
- The elenchus (Socratic method) and its philosophical power
- Socratic intellectualism and virtue
- The trial and death of Socrates

### Week 3: Plato's Theory of Forms
As Socrates' most brilliant student, Plato developed a comprehensive philosophical system centered on his Theory of Forms and the structure of the ideal state.

- The divided line and levels of knowledge
- The allegory of the cave
- The Theory of Forms (Ideas)
- Platonic epistemology: knowledge as recollection
- The tripartite soul and Plato's ethical theory

### Week 4: Aristotle's Ethics and Metaphysics
Aristotle's empirical approach and systematic philosophy marks another turning point in ancient thought. We'll examine his ethical theory and fundamental metaphysical concepts.

- Virtue ethics and the golden mean
- Eudaimonia (flourishing) as the highest good
- The four causes
- Substance, form, and matter
- Aristotle's Categories and logical works

### Week 5: Hellenistic Schools: Epicureanism
Following Alexander's conquests, philosophy fragmented into competing schools. We'll first examine Epicureanism, with its materialist physics and hedonistic ethics.

- Epicurean atomism
- Pleasure as absence of pain (ataraxia)
- The tetrapharmakos (four-part cure)
- Epicurean views on death, gods, and fate
- The Epicurean community at the Garden

### Week 6: Hellenistic Schools: Stoicism
Stoicism emerged as one of the most influential philosophical schools of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, with its emphasis on virtue, reason, and living according to nature.

- Stoic physics and theology
- The dichotomy of control
- Virtue as the only good
- Stoic psychology and the passions
- From Zeno to Epictetus: Stoicism's evolution

### Week 7: Skepticism and Academic Philosophy
Skeptical traditions challenged dogmatic claims to knowledge, developing sophisticated arguments about the limitations of human understanding.

- Pyrrho and Pyrrhonian skepticism
- Academic skepticism: Arcesilaus and Carneades
- Skeptical arguments and modes
- Living without certainty
- Sextus Empiricus and skepticism's legacy

### Week 8: Neoplatonism and the Transition to Medieval Thought
The course concludes with Neoplatonism, which synthesized elements of Platonism with religious mysticism, profoundly influencing later Christian, Jewish, and Islamic philosophy.

- Plotinus and the One
- The theory of emanation
- The soul's ascent and mystical union
- Porphyry and Iamblichus
- Neoplatonism's influence on medieval thought

## Join Us on This Philosophical Journey

Philosophy begins in wonder, as both Plato and Aristotle observed. This course invites you to wonder alongside the ancient thinkers who first formulated many of the questions we still grapple with today: What is reality? How do we know what we know? What constitutes a good life?

By engaging with these foundational thinkers, you'll not only gain historical knowledge but also develop conceptual tools for your own philosophical reflection. We look forward to exploring these timeless questions with you!
